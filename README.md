This repo contains my study notes for C++.

### C++ Build Process - from source code to executable
- Preprocessor
 
expands the source code to include any files specified with the `#include` commands, and to expand any macro, specified with the `#define` declarations.

- Compiler

generates assembly code version of source files (`*.s` files)

- Assembler

converts the assembly code into binary _object-code_ files (`*.o` files)

- Linker

merges the object-code files with the code implementing library functions and generates the final executable code file.
